#### Purpose: 
a simple java program that calculates the **Modular Exponentiation** (in terms of loop)

#### WHY!: 
Because the mathematicians people -crypto people in specific- ask us to calculate it by hand, BUT we are programmers and lazy, so we automate it! 

#### Output:

#### Current issues (Trying to fix it): 
- Please NOTE: Since the program relies on **Math.pow()**, you will get accurate results only when the number of digits (results from **Math.pow**) is less than **18 Digits**. 
Check the below screenshot for more details.
